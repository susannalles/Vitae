Structure of the text 

1. This project contains a serie of biographies written in Latin by Italian humanists and translated by Alfonso de Palencia at the end of the XVth century.

2. The goal is to publish the Latin text and an Spanish translation and display them synchronically in a unique a simple interface. 

3. The text, both the Latin and Spanish, are stored in separated XML-TEI. 

4. Given the fact that it is a work in progress we need to preserve the XML-TEI files which will be constantly updated and re-build the static site directly from theses files.
