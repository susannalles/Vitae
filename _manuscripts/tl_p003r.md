<title id=“p003r_a1">Imitation coral</title>


<ab id=“p003r_b1">One must first make the branches from wood or take a fantastical thorn branch, then melt a pound of the best possible clear pine resin and add one ounce of finely ground vermilion together with walnut oil, and if you add a little Venice lake the color will be all the more vivid, and stir all together into the resin, molten over a charcoal fire, not over an open flame, lest it catch fire. Then dip in your branches with a swirling motion. And should there remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the charcoal.</ab>


<note id=“p003r_c1a”>Colophony is nothing other than resin that has been cooked again. To do it well, you take a leaded pot and melt the resin, boiling it over the brazier for a good hour until it appears not thick but clear and liquid like water and it easily runs as a thread off the end of a stick, which you use to crush and test it. Then pour it through a coarse canvas or tammy cloth so that it falls into the strongest vinegar you can find, because the vinegar makes it strong and makes it less brittle. Repeat this two or three times and it will be fine and well purified. To imitate your coral, you can mix a fourth part of mastic with your purified resin to make it more solid and finer, and if you should use just one drop of mastic, it would be all the better, but it would take too long.</note>


<note id=“p003r_c1b”>Sulfur and vermilion have the same effect.</note>


<note id=“p003r_c1c”>Coral made of red enamel withstands filing and polishing.</note>


<note id=“p003r_c1d”>It is made like cement, which is stronger when mixed with crushed glass rather than with brick. In the same way, together with the vermilion, one mixes in opaque red enamel[a], finely ground. It is the same way with all enamel colors.</note>


<title id="p003r_a2">Varnish for paintings</title>


<ab id="p003r_b2">Take a pound of Venice turpentine and heat it in a pot until it simmers, put in half a pound of the whitest turpentine oil you can find and stir all together well on a charcoal fire and take it off immediately after, and it is done. But if you find it too thick, add more oil, whereas if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little turpentine. And so you will give it whatever consistency you want. It could be made without fire, but it is more desiccative when heated. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things, without distorting the colors or yellowing, and dries both in the shade and under the sun, overnight, and during the summer as well as in the winter. It is usually sold 15 sols a pound.</ab>


<note id=”p003r_c2a>You need a little more turpentine than turpentine oil to thicken the varnish, which you need to apply with your finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick because when it is thick, it turns yellow and gathers [together]. Varnish is not used to make paintings shine, because it just takes the light out of them.</note>


<note id=”p003r_c2b”>But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust. Mastic varnish does not resist rain, whereas oil and rosin varnishes do.</note>
 
<title id=”p003r_a3”>Thick varnish for floorboards[b]</title>
 
<ab id=”p003r_b3a”>There is a type of varnish that takes a long time to dry and is still damp up to two months after it has been applied to the floorboards. But the following varnish does not remain damp like previous ones, which were made of linseed oil boiled with garlic to extinguish them[c] and rid them of fat, and also with wheat. And this old one yellowed over time and made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like [former varnishes] except that one puts in common thick turpentine</ab>








[a]"en corps" seems to refer to opaqueness: see e.g. <ab id=”p038r_b4”>, "l'ambre transparent et a l'aultre qui a corps"
[b]Note: planchers can also mean ceilings, i.e. any large surface covered in "planches" (boards). Only French plancher is horizontal, English boarding is vertical…
[c]literally. NB estaindre, not estendre
